From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Practicing html/css by recreating the Google homepage.

I spent 15 minutes on this. I understand html/css pretty well, so I didn't feel the need to get it perfect. Fun, quick exercise, though!
